nAquarium

About:
This is a visual program for the TI-nSpire!  It works on the TI-nSpire CX CAS with ndless 3.1.  At this time I don't know about whether it will work on other models.  It is not a game; just something to look at!

How to put on Calculator:
Start up TI-NSpire Student Software or whatever you use to put it on the calculator.  Then just drag-n-drop the nAquarium-sdl.tns file onto your calculator.  First if you don't have it; install ndless 3.1!

How to use:
Once you start it up there are 3 fish to look at.  When you are done press the 'esc' button to exit.  The fish don't interact with any keypresses.

Source:
I included my source.  I programmed with C++ which you can find out more here: http://blog.tangrs.id.au/?p=712  It uses nSDL as well as the ndless Software Development Kit.  I encourage you (if you want) to get as much enjoyment as you want from this program!  So go ahead and change the source (such as the number of fish) and compile!  Make any adjustments you'd like!
